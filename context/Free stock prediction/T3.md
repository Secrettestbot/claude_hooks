## Work Completed
✅ Adaptive Selection (52-53% accuracy)
✅ Dynamic Ensemble (49-53% accuracy)
✅ Simple Stacking baseline
⏳ Game theory scripts created but need parameter optimization

## Next Steps
1. Fix game theory parameters (reduce agents)
2. Run game_theory/run_all_game_theory.py
3. Save results to t3_game_theory_results.json

See PROJECT_STATUS.md for details.
